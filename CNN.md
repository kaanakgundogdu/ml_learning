That's a great starting point! Given your background in computer science and software engineering, you already have a solid foundation that will help you pick up AI concepts, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here’s a structured approach to help you get started with CNNs and AI in general:

### 1. **Understand the Basics of AI and Machine Learning**
   Since you're new to AI, it’s important to first build a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of AI and machine learning (ML). Once you have a grasp of those, diving into CNNs will be much easier.

   - **Key Concepts to Learn**:
     - **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**: Learn about the two main paradigms of machine learning and the difference between tasks like classification and regression.
     - **Algorithms**: Understand basic machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
     - **Model Training**: Learn how models are trained using data, how loss functions work, and how optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent help minimize the error in predictions.

   - **Resources**:
     - **Books**:
       - *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"* by Aurélien Géron (great for beginners).
       - *"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"* by Christopher Bishop.
     - **Courses**:
       - [Coursera - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): A classic and highly recommended introductory course for machine learning.
       - [Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/): A hands-on course that covers deep learning and CNNs starting from basic concepts.

### 2. **Learn Python for Machine Learning**
   If you're not already familiar with Python, it's important to get comfortable with it, as it's the most popular language used in AI and machine learning. You can start with basic Python syntax and then move on to libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib that are heavily used in data manipulation and visualization.

   - **Resources**:
     - **Python Basics**: Python documentation, or resources like *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart.
     - **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib**: These are libraries you’ll use extensively in data processing and visualization.

### 3. **Understand Neural Networks (Deep Learning)**
   Once you understand basic machine learning, move on to neural networks and deep learning. A neural network is the foundation for CNNs, so it's essential to understand its structure and how it works.

   - **Key Concepts to Learn**:
     - **Neurons and Layers**: Learn about how artificial neurons mimic biological neurons and how layers of neurons are used in networks.
     - **Feedforward and Backpropagation**: Understand how information flows through a neural network (feedforward) and how networks learn (backpropagation and gradient descent).
     - **Activation Functions**: Learn about functions like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Softmax.
   
   - **Resources**:
     - **Deep Learning Book**: *"Deep Learning"* by Ian Goodfellow (more advanced, but excellent as a resource).
     - **Courses**:
       - [Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): A great series of courses by Andrew Ng on deep learning, including CNNs.
       - [Fast.ai - Deep Learning Part 1](https://course.fast.ai/): A very practical approach to learning deep learning.

### 4. **Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   Now, you're ready to dive into CNNs specifically. Since CNNs are a type of deep neural network, most of what you learned about neural networks will be applicable here. CNNs are specialized for tasks like image classification, object detection, etc.

   - **Key Concepts to Learn**:
     - **Convolution Operation**: Understand how convolution layers work and how they detect local features (e.g., edges, textures) in images.
     - **Pooling**: Learn how pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) help reduce dimensionality and retain important features.
     - **Fully Connected Layers**: Understand how fully connected layers at the end of a CNN are used for classification.
     - **Activation and Softmax**: Learn about the activation functions used in CNNs and how the Softmax function helps in classification tasks.

   - **Resources**:
     - **Tutorials**:
       - [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/): Stanford’s computer vision course is an excellent resource.
       - [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io/examples/): Keras is a high-level neural network API, and they have many examples of CNNs.
     - **Courses**:
       - [Fast.ai - Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/): This covers CNNs very early on and gives you hands-on experience with them.
       - [Coursera - Convolutional Neural Networks by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks): A focused course on CNNs from the Deep Learning Specialization.

### 5. **Hands-On Practice**
   One of the best ways to learn CNNs (or any deep learning concept) is through hands-on practice. Here are a few ways to do this:
   
   - **Keras and TensorFlow**: These libraries are great for beginners and provide high-level APIs to implement CNNs and other deep learning models.
     - Start by using simple datasets like MNIST (handwritten digits) and CIFAR-10 (small color images).
   - **Project Ideas**:
     - **Image Classification**: Use CNNs to classify images from a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or fashion MNIST).
     - **Object Detection**: Use pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect objects in images.
     - **Transfer Learning**: Take a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet or VGG16) and fine-tune it for your own dataset.
   
   - **Resources**:
     - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Kaggle has tons of datasets and coding competitions where you can practice deep learning.
     - [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials): TensorFlow’s official website has a lot of tutorials on CNNs.

### 6. **Explore Real-World Applications**
   Once you’re comfortable with CNNs, dive into specific applications of computer vision like:
   - **Face Recognition**: CNNs are used in systems like facial recognition for security.
   - **Self-Driving Cars**: CNNs help recognize objects, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
   - **Medical Image Analysis**: CNNs are widely used in diagnosing diseases from medical images (like detecting tumors from CT scans).

   This will give you a broader perspective on how CNNs are applied in real-world scenarios.
